# LemmyVTTS

LemmyVTTS is a program to automatically convert Lemmy comments into a video. This project is inspired by the Reddit equivalent.

# Usage
Before everything, install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After that, you should configure the settings (constants) inside main.py and also set your preferred browser of choice to take screenshots of the comments in screenshotLemmy.py

Then run main.py
```
python main.py
```

As long as everything is configured correctly and the instance works, no errors should appear.
